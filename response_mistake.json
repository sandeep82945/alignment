These mistakes significantly impact the coherence of the summary and should have been given more weight in my evaluation.\n\nTo avoid similar mistakes in the future, I will make sure to be more meticulous in my evaluation, paying close attention to the summary's structure, sentence-level coherence, and accuracy. I will also strive to be more objective and not overlook flaws in the summary's coherence. By doing so, I hope to provide more accurate and reliable evaluations in the future."

        "full_responses": "- Coherence: 4\n\nThe summary is well-structured and well-organized, covering the main topic and key points of the news article. The sentences are clear and logically connected, building a coherent body of information about River Plate's interest in signing Radamel Falcao. The summary effectively conveys the main idea of the article, which is River Plate's desire to re-sign Falcao, and provides relevant background information about Falcao's past with the club.\n\nThe only reason I didn't give it a perfect score of 5 is that the summary is a bit repetitive, with the first and third sentences being very similar. This repetition makes the summary feel a bit disjointed and could be improved by rephrasing or combining the sentences to create a smoother flow. Overall, however, the summary is clear, concise, and effectively conveys the main points of the article.",

Upon re-reading the summary, I realize that it lacks a clear structure and logical flow. The sentences seem to be a collection of related information rather than a cohesive narrative.\n\nSpecifically, the summary fails to establish a clear connection between the sentences, and the transitions between them are abrupt. The first sentence introduces the idea that River Plate wants to sign Falcao, but the second sentence feels like a non-sequitur, providing unnecessary background information about Falcao's past with the club. The third sentence is repetitive and doesn't add much new information, making the summary feel disjointed.\n\nTo avoid making similar mistakes in the future, I should be more rigorous in my evaluation of coherence. Here are some strategies I can use:\n\n1. Look for clear transitions between sentences: Do the sentences flow logically from one to the next, or do they feel disconnected?\n2. Check for redundancy: Are there any sentences that repeat information or don't add much new value to the summary?\n3. Evaluate the summary's overall structure: Does the summary have a clear introduction, body, and conclusion, or does it feel like a collection of unrelated sentences?\n\nBy applying these strategies, I can provide more accurate and nuanced evaluations of coherence in the future.

Upon reflection, I realize that I made a mistake because I was too focused on the summary's lack of detail and context, and I didn't give enough credit to its overall structure and coherence.\n\nHere are some specific reasons why I made this mistake:\n\n1. **Overemphasis on detail**: I was too critical of the summary's brevity and lack of specific examples, which led me to overlook its overall coherence. I should have focused more on how the sentences work together to convey a clear message, rather than dwelling on what's missing.\n\n2. **Misinterpreting vagueness**: I misinterpreted the summary's vague statements (e.g., \"He's a player who needs to be more consistent\") as a lack of coherence, when in fact, they still contribute to the overall narrative. I should have considered the possibility that these statements are intentionally general to provide a broader context.\n\n3. **Insufficient consideration of sentence relationships**: I didn't adequately analyze how the sentences relate to each other. For example, the second sentence (\"Falcao has to work harder.\") can be seen as a justification for why Falcao would have been better off staying at Monaco, which creates a logical flow. I should have paid closer attention to these relationships.\n\nTo avoid similar mistakes in the future, I will:\n\n1. **Focus on the summary's overall structure**: Instead of getting bogged down in details, I'll prioritize evaluating how the sentences work together to convey a coherent message.\n\n2. **Consider the purpose of vague statements**: I'll be more open to the possibility that vague statements serve a purpose in the summary, such as providing context or setting up subsequent points.\n\n3. **Analyze sentence relationships more carefully**: I'll make a conscious effort to examine how each sentence relates to the others, looking for logical connections and flow.\n\nBy adopting these strategies, I hope to improve my evaluation skills and provide more accurate scores in the future."

Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds , which assess English , maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury , Gloucestershire . This was despite the exam session finishing , a conduct panel heard . Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury , pictured , to make the changes to their SATs exam answers The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil 's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off . After the suspected breach of exam rules , school officials were tipped off , resulting in an investigation being launched in June . The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same . It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year , the hearing was told . Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct . The Department for Education annulled the whole school 's SAT 's results after a probe by the local education authority ( file picture ) However , he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers , but to make them more legible . But the panel , run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership , said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions . Panel chair Martin Pilkington said , although the teacher \u2019 s conduct had been dishonest , it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty . But he added : 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school , that can in no way excuse his behaviour . 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority . ' Paul Heathcote , acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan , banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years . He said : 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014 . 'Mr Guffick \u2019 s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress . 'In all the circumstances , I agree with the panel \u2019 s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction . 'Mr Guffick has shown remorse and insight and he deeply regrets his actions .

Nathan Hughes 's knee collided with George North 's head as he crossed the line to score for Northampton North was left out cold on the pitch at Franklin 's Gardens and had to be taken off on a stretcher It was the third time that the Wales and Lions winger had been knocked out in the space of two months Fiji-born forward Hughes missed his side 's Champions Cup quarter-final loss against Toulon last Sunday North was left unconscious by the clash ; a third blow to the head in the space of two months . He has since been advised to take a minimum of a month off from playing , to counter-act his concussion symptoms . Graphic , slow-motion footage of the incident at Franklin \u2019 s Gardens led some observers to condemn Hughes , but many more spoke up in his defence . Wasps were incensed that the forward had been suspended \u2013 and their dismay was shared by others outside the club . Captain James Haskell said : \u2018 Astounded would be an under-statement \u2019 , while fly-half Andy Goode added : \u2018 Really can \u2019 t believe or understand the ban for Nathan Hughes . There was no intent and I feel the accident has been judged on outcome. \u2019 Former England player Austin Healey branded the sentence a \u2018 total joke \u2019 and Harlequins captain Joe Marler echoed his sentiment , calling it an \u2018 absolute joke \u2019 . Hughes was sent off and then banned for three weeks following the incident on March 27 Hughes missed his club \u2019 s Champions Cup defeat to holders Toulon last Sunday , as he awaited his appeal hearing . He is now free to return to action immediately , but he is not in the match-day squad for Wasps \u2019 Aviva Premiership trip to London Welsh tomorrow and given the formality of a victory in that fixture , he is unlikely to play again until the visit of Exeter to Coventry on April 26 . Jeremy Summers , chairman of the appeal hearing panel , said : \u2018 The appeal panel considered it appropriate to hear the matter afresh . Having done so and having had the advantage of evidence not before the original panel , it concluded that no act of foul play took place in that the incident occurred accidentally . \u2019\n\nSummary:\n\nThe wasps no 8 was initially suspended for three matches , after a disciplinary panel ruled he had been ` reckless ' for failing to prevent his knee colliding with the head of the welsh lion , as he scored a try for northampton on march 27 . Hughes was shown a red card for the offence , but that dismissal has now been officially rescinded . Nathan hughes 's knee collided with george north 's head as he crossed the line to score for northampton . Fiji-born forward hughes missed his side 's champions cup quarter-final loss against toulon last sunday .\n\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n\n- Coherence:",

The sentences are well-structured and build upon each other to provide a coherent body of information about the topic. The summary effectively conveys the sequence of events, including the initial suspension, the appeal, and the outcome. The language is also clear and concise, making it easy to follow. \n\nHowever, the summary could be improved by providing more context and connecting the sentences more smoothly.

With some minor adjustments to address these issues, the coherence of the summary could be further enhanced.",

The sentences seem to be a collection of related information rather than building upon each other to form a cohesive narrative. The summary mainly focuses on Hart's praise for Buffon, but it doesn't provide a clear flow of ideas or a logical connection between the sentences. The transition between the two sentences is abrupt, and the second sentence seems to repeat the information from the first sentence. Additionally, the summary doesn't provide any context or background information about the event or the significance of the 147th cap, which makes it difficult for the reader to understand the full context of the story.

A look at all of the charges The sentencing phase begins Tuesday , a day after this year 's edition of the landmark race . It is expected to last four weeks . The 13th Juror : Now it gets real In a front-page opinion piece in The Boston Globe , Bill and Denise Richard wrote about the toll taken on their family after the death of their 8-year-old son , Martin . Their daughter , Jane , also was severely injured . `` Our family has grieved , buried our young son , battled injuries , and endured numerous surgeries -- all while trying to rebuild lives that will never be the same , '' they said in the Globe column titled `` To end the anguish , drop the death penalty . '' `` We sat in the courtroom , day after day , bearing witness to overwhelming evidence that included graphic video and photographs , replicated bombs , and even the clothes our son wore his last day alive . '' They said they understood the `` heinousness and brutality of the crimes committed . '' `` We were there . We lived it . The defendant murdered our 8-year-old son , maimed our 7-year-old daughter , and stole part of our soul . '' But now the Richards are urging the Justice Department to bring the case to a close . `` We are in favor of and would support the Department of Justice in taking the death penalty off the table in exchange for the defendant spending the rest of his life in prison without any possibility of release and waiving all of his rights to appeal , '' they wrote . They go on to say : `` We know that the government has its reasons for seeking the death penalty , but the continued pursuit of that punishment could bring years of appeals and prolong reliving the most painful day of our lives . We hope our two remaining children do not have to grow up with the lingering , painful reminder of what the defendant took from them , which years of appeals would undoubtedly bring . '' Martin Richard and two others were killed and more 200 people wounded when a pair of bombs went off within 12 seconds of each other at the finish line on April 15 , 2013 . Tsarnaev was convicted last week , while his brother , Tamerlan , was killed in a shootout with police two years ago . The Richards never mention Tsarnaev by name .

SpaceX founder Elon Musk tweeted : `` Ascent successful . Dragon enroute to Space Station . Rocket landed on droneship , but too hard for survival . '' He later clarified that the rocket landed , but tipped over . SpaceX tried to land a Falcon 9 on the drone ship in January , but the rocket hit at an angle and exploded . SpaceX has said it will keep trying and , after it masters landing at sea , hopes to someday land rockets on the ground . Usually booster rockets burn up in Earth 's atmosphere or , like NASA 's space shuttle boosters , they fall back into the ocean . So why try to land one ? Musk wants to cut costs . On his company 's website , he says that if anyone can figure out how to `` reuse rockets just like airplanes , the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred . '' What about the rest of the rocket and the Dragon ? The smaller , top part of the rocket will carry the Dragon into orbit and then break away from the cargo ship and burn up in Earth 's atmosphere . The Dragon will dock with the space station a couple of days after launch to deliver more than 4,300 pounds ( 1,950 kilograms ) of supplies , including research equipment and ISSpresso , an espresso maker that astronauts can use to make coffee and tea . The space station crew will spend about five weeks unpacking the Dragon . They 'll then stuff it with over 3,000 pounds of science experiments , trash and other stuff to send back to Earth . When they 're done , Dragon will leave the space station and mission controllers will guide it to splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off California . This is the sixth SpaceX mission to the International Space Station . The company was the first private space contractor to dock with the station .

Nothing is sacred in the team . When Ben Stokes first turned up at the Kensington Oval this week someone would have said : \u2018 Mind that locker , Stokesey. \u2019 It was here , of course , that Stokes broke his wrist punching a locker after being dismissed last year and that will be a reminder to him of the need to channel his aggression in the right way now he is back in the England team . Ben Stokes has forged a reputation as a fiery character in the England cricket team Stokes ( left ) clashed with Marlon Samuels during the second Test between West Indies and England But Stokes ( right ) responded positively to the row after talking to England coach Peter Moores Only a slight niggle in his back might stop Stokes playing here in Barbados and I am glad he has fought his way back after what has been a year of ups and downs . I like Stokes and I like his character at a time when the game can be perceived as producing robots and players who can not capture the imagination . He has something about him , as he showed when he was in Mitchell Johnson \u2019 s face during the Ashes series . He was not worried about the bombardment he would get in return . But I do believe he will need careful man-managing . Peter Moores , England \u2019 s coach , dragged him to one side after his clash with Marlon Samuels in the second Test and had a long chat with him and if it was to talk about how he should respond then the advice he gave was clearly right . The way he approached the Jamaican after that third-day salute was spot on . England must make sure they do not quash that natural exuberance and desire to take someone on . It will not always come off but we have to accept that there will be lows as well as highs with this lad . What Stokes must not do is try to live up to his reputation and become pigeon-holed . He can be feisty and fiery as long as it \u2019 s natural but his aggression has to be controlled . You want the character as long as the end product is runs and wickets . Stokes ( second left ) can use his aggression to bring runs and wickets to the England team Stokes ( left ) congratulates England captain Alastair Cook after the side won the second Test England want to have Stokes in the team as much as possible to help him hit his full potential Let him go a bit but rein him in occasionally . There is an argument here to play the second spinner in Adil Rashid and if England went down that route in Bridgetown the place of Stokes or Chris Jordan would come into question but they clearly want both to play as much as possible . This summer there will rarely be the need for two spinners so England want these two exciting cricketers to grow into the international game . They can only get better and that \u2019 s an exciting prospect .\n\nSummary:\n\nBen stokes has forged a reputation as a fiery character in the england cricket team . Stokes broke his wrist punching a locker after being dismissed last year . He was not worried about the bombardment he would get in return .\n\n\nEvaluation Form (scores ONLY):\n\n- Coherence:",
        "full_responses": "- Coherence: 2\n\nThe summary lacks coherence as it appears to be a collection of disconnected sentences. The first sentence introduces Ben Stokes as a fiery character, but the second sentence abruptly shifts to an incident from last year where he broke his wrist. The third sentence seems out of place, as it doesn't build upon the previous sentences or provide a clear connection to the topic. The sentences do not flow logically, and the summary lacks a clear structure or organization. The main topic of the article, which appears to be about Ben Stokes' character and his potential in the England cricket team, is not clearly conveyed in the summary. The sentences seem to be randomly selected from the article without consideration for how they fit together to form a cohesive summary.",

Omar did n't say what led to the release , other than asserting that Arab tribal leaders helped to coordinate it . The freed Yazidis were received by Peshmerga , who sent them to the Kurdish regional capital , Irbil , said Nuri Osman , an official with Iraq 's Kurdistan Regional Government . It was n't immediately clear what motivated Wednesday 's release , Osman said . Osman said 217 Yazidis were released . Omar , the Peshmerga commander , had a higher count : 228 . ISIS previously released scores of other Yazidis -- largely children and the elderly -- since attacking the group 's towns last year . The Sunni Islamist militant group steamrolled into Iraq 's north last summer , forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities -- Yazidis among them -- from their homes . Yazidis are of Kurdish descent , and their religion is considered a pre-Islamic sect that draws from Christianity , Judaism and Zoroastrianism . One of the oldest religious communities in the world , the Yazidis have long suffered persecution , with many Muslims referring to them as devil worshipers . ISIS ' cruelty to them has been extraordinary . ISIS ' conquest of the town of Sinjar , in particular , provoked a major humanitarian crisis as some Yazidis fled into the mountains -- where many became trapped for a time without food and water -- and others fled by foot into neighboring Syria . ISIS slaughtered Yazidis by the hundreds , Yian Dakhil , the only lawmaker representing the Yazidis in Iraq 's Parliament , told CNN last year . Reports emerged from some Yazidi survivors that ISIS raped and enslaved female Yazidi captives . An international coalition responded , first by airdropping supplies in the mountains . Rescues came next . And then , starting in August , the United States and other nations conducted airstrikes targeting ISIS in Iraq and Syria . The U.S. State Department estimates that 500,000 Yazidis live in northern Iraq , accounting for less than 1 % of the country 's population . CNN 's Raja Razek reported from Beirut .

The whale , named Varvara , swam nearly 14,000 miles ( 22,500 kilometers ) , according to a release from Oregon State University , whose scientists helped conduct the whale-tracking study . Varvara , which is Russian for `` Barbara , '' left her primary feeding ground off Russia 's Sakhalin Island to cross the Pacific Ocean and down the West Coast of the United States to Baja , Mexico . Varvara 's journey surpassed a record listed on the Guinness Worlds Records website . It said the previous record was set by a humpback whale that swam a mere 10,190-mile round trip between the `` warm breeding waters near the equator and the colder food-rich waters of the Arctic and Antarctic regions . '' Records are nice , but Bruce Mate , the lead author of the study , thinks the long trip might say more about the whale than just its ability to swim . During her 14,000-mile journey , Varvara visited `` three major breeding areas for eastern gray whales , '' which was a surprise to Mate , who is also the director of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University . `` For her to go to Mexico , '' Mate said , `` It 's pretty strong evidence that it 's where she 's from . '' Varvara was thought to be an endangered western whale , but her ability to `` navigate across open water over tremendously long distances is impressive , '' he said in the release , which could mean that some western gray whales are actually eastern grays . With only 150 western gray whales believed to be in existence , that number might be even lower . `` Past studies have indicated genetic differentiation between the species , but this suggests we may need to take a closer look , '' Mate said .

        "full_responses": "- Coherence: 4\n\nThe summary is well-structured and easy to follow, presenting the main topic and key points of the news article in a clear and logical order. The first sentence introduces the main topic, which is Mark Clattenburg being named to take charge of the Manchester derby. The second sentence provides additional context about Vincent Kompany's suspension, which is relevant to the derby. The third sentence reiterates the main topic, stating that Clattenburg will officiate the Manchester derby.\n\nThe summary is coherent because it presents a clear narrative flow, with each sentence building on the previous one to provide a concise overview of the news article. The language is also simple and easy to understand, making it accessible to a wide range of readers.\n\nHowever, I did not give it a perfect score of 5 because the summary could be improved by providing more context or connections between the sentences. For example, the second sentence about Kompany's suspension feels a bit disconnected from the rest of the summary, and could be better integrated to provide a more cohesive narrative. Additionally, the summary could benefit from a clearer conclusion or final thought to wrap up the main points. Overall, the summary is well-structured and easy to follow, but could be improved with some minor adjustments.",

Although there was no dispute between the team-mates this time , it brought back memories of Everton 's match against West Brom in January when Kevin Mirallas grabbed the ball from Baines to take a penalty - and missed . Ross Barkley steps up to take a 10th minute penalty despite the presence of Leighton Baines on the pitch Barkley 's effort is saved by Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton at Goodison Park Martinez insisted Barkley was within his rights to request penalty-taking duties on Saturday . 'If Romelu Lukaku had been on the pitch , he would have taken it . Otherwise , I am happy to have three or four players who can take penalties and let it depend on how they feel at that moment , ' argued the Everton manager . Baines ( left ) has scored 15 penalties from 16 attempts in the Premier League 'Ross showed incredible responsibility to take it .

A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit . Stephen Munden , 54 , ( pictured with and without a beard ) was last seen leaving a hospital , near Hook , Hampshire He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall , of a heavy build , and has dark hair . Officers said they believed that Munden , who suffers from learning difficulties , may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave . He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences . Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13 . A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child 's mother and grandmother . Munden , formerly of Marchwood , near Southampton , denied the offence , claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court . During the sentencing David Jenkins , prosecuting , told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children . The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images . Mr Jenkins said children 's clothes , books and dolls were found at Munden 's home and added : 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls .

Keely Harvey , in mitigation , said : 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child 's hand . ' But the judge said 'the move from non-contact offences to a contact offence is significant ' and he was made the subject of a hospital order .

        "full_responses": "- Coherence: 2\n\nThe summary lacks coherence as it only presents a single piece of information about Gnabry's injury without providing any context or building upon it. The summary does not cover the main topic of the news article, which is Gnabry's progress and return to the game after his injury. Additionally, the summary does not present the information in a clear and logical order, as it only focuses on the injury without mentioning Gnabry's current status or his quotes about feeling better. A coherent summary would have provided a more comprehensive overview of the article, including Gnabry's return to playing and his positive outlook.",

        "mistake_responses": "I made a mistake!\n\nUpon self-reflection, I realize that I was too harsh in my evaluation. I focused too much on what the summary was lacking, rather than what it did well. Here are some specific reasons why I made this mistake:\n\n1. **Overemphasis on completeness**: I was expecting the summary to cover all the key points of the article, including Gnabry's progress and quotes. However, I should have recognized that the summary was concise and focused on a specific aspect of the article, which is still a valid approach.\n2. **Lack of consideration for brevity**: The summary was short and to the point, which can be a strength in terms of coherence. I should have acknowledged that the summary was well-structured and easy to follow, even if it didn't cover all the details.\n3. **Insufficient attention to sentence structure**: The summary consisted of a single, clear sentence that conveyed a specific piece of information. I should have given more credit for the sentence's clarity and simplicity, which contributed to the summary's overall coherence.\n\nTo avoid similar mistakes in the future, I will:\n\n1. **Evaluate summaries based on their own merit**, rather than comparing them to an ideal summary in my mind.\n2. **Consider the strengths of concise summaries**, recognizing that brevity can be a virtue in terms of coherence.\n3. **Analyze sentence structure and clarity**, giving credit to summaries that effectively convey information through well-crafted sentences.\n\nBy keeping these points in mind, I hope to provide more accurate and fair evaluations in the future. Thank you for the feedback!"

The second sentence, \"Mr. Phillips had caught the cab home after a night out with friends in December. He didn't have enough cash to pay for it,\" seems unrelated to the first sentence and doesn't explain why Jacob Phillips jumped over the fence.

However, the summary provided was concise and to the point, which made me overlook its coherence.\n\nThe two sentences in the summary, although brief, do provide a clear and logical sequence of events. The first sentence sets the scene for the incident, and the second sentence explains the motivation behind Jacob Phillips' action. The summary effectively conveys the main topic and key points of the news article, which is Jacob Phillips' accidental death due to trying to avoid paying the taxi fare.\n\nIn similar scenarios, I should remember to evaluate the summary based on its ability to convey the main topic and key points, regardless of its length or complexity. I should also avoid making assumptions about what a \"good\" summary should look like and instead focus on the clarity and logic of the sentences.\n\nTo improve, I will make sure to:\n\n1. Read the summary more carefully and focus on its ability to convey the main topic and key points.\n2. Avoid making assumptions about the ideal length or complexity of a summary.\n3.
