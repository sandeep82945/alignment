Christopher Lawler said he was pinned to a chair and groped by a male member of staff on his first day working at Clarence House . The ordeal left him in tears and he left the job the same day . He finally decided to contact palace officials again last year after inquiries began into alleged cover-ups of child sex abuse by a VIP paedophile ring in the 1970s and 80s . Police are investigating claims made by a former royal footman that Clarence House aides tried to force him into an orgy in the 1970s But his complaints were ignored for months before the police were finally notified , he claims . Mr Lawler , now 64 , said the attempted abuse at the Queen Mother \u2019 s London residence happened in January 1978 when he was 27 . He said he was accosted after he walked into a bedroom to look for a pen on his first shift . Two men offered him a drink before two other men joined them \u2013 one a senior member of staff , he said . He was asked if he was gay before a younger man took his trousers off and began performing a sex act on himself . \u2018 That prompted another guy to put his hand on my leg and then he grabbed me , \u2019 he told the Sunday People . \u2018 I was staggered .

Mr Lawler worked at Clarence House when the Queen Mother used it as her London residence \u2018 They were trying to undo my trousers but I managed to jump up and burst out of the room. \u2019 Afterwards , Mr Lawler said he was followed by two men and threatened to keep quiet . A complaint he made that day allegedly drew an angry response from Clarence House \u2013 so he packed his bags immediately . Mr Lawler , a former Port of Liverpool police officer , said he was \u2018 haunted \u2019 by the incident for years . After hearing about the probe into historical cases of child abuse last year he wrote to the Palace , but was twice rebuffed . Months later the complaint was finally passed to Scotland Yard . A retired royal aide , who is now in his 80s , was reportedly interviewed but denied he was involved because he was working for the Queen in Balmoral at the time . Mr Lawler has now been told by the Palace that the Royal Household would work \u2018 exhaustively and co-operatively \u2019 with any police probe .

Since this feedback is not related to the original text and summary I evaluated, I assume it's a general feedback on the evaluation process.\n\nHowever, I can apply the same evaluation steps to the original text and summary you provided:\n\n**Source Text:**\n\nThe European Union has announced plans to introduce a universal charger for mobile phones, tablets, and other devices. The EU believes that a single charger would reduce electronic waste and make life easier for consumers. The EU has been pushing for a universal charger for over a decade, but manufacturers have resisted the idea, citing concerns about innovation and cost. The EU's internal market commissioner, Thierry Breton, said that the proposal would put an end to the \"nightmare\" of having multiple chargers for different devices. The EU estimates that the average person owns at least three mobile phone chargers, and that 50% of charger sales are for replacement chargers. The proposal would also apply to laptops, with the EU aiming to reduce electronic waste by 1,000 tonnes per year.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nThe EU has announced plans for a universal charger for mobile phones, tablets, and other devices. This would reduce electronic waste and make life easier for consumers.\n\nLet's go through the evaluation steps:\n\n1. Read the summary and the source document carefully.\n\nDone.\n\n2.

Assess how well the summary covers the main points of the article, and how much irrelevant or redundant information it contains.\n\nThe summary covers the following main points:\n- The EU has announced plans for a universal charger.\n- The goal is to reduce electronic waste and make life easier for consumers.\n\nHowever, the summary misses the following important points:\n- The proposal has been resisted by manufacturers due to concerns about innovation and cost.\n- The EU estimates that the average person owns at least three mobile phone chargers.\n- The proposal would also apply to laptops, aiming to reduce electronic waste by 1,000 tonnes per year.\n\nThe summary does not contain any redundancy.\n\n4. Assign a relevance score from 1 to 5.\n\nConsidering the summary's coverage of the main points, I would argue that the score should be 4, as the summary covers the most important points, but misses some details.",

Most migrants recorded this year come from countries in West Africa as well as Somalia and Syria , the IOM said . They use Libya as a country of transit . At least 480 migrants have died while crossing the Mediterranean since the beginning of the year , often because of bad weather and overcrowded vessels used by smugglers , the IOM said .

The summary does miss some important points, such as the rising wave of migrants, the large number of rescues, and the upsurge in migrant boats crossing the Mediterranean. Additionally, the second point in the summary is redundant, as it's already implied in the first point.\n\nConsidering these points, I agree that a score of 5 is too high.

        "source": "Rome ( CNN ) Italy is coping with a rising wave of desperate migrants from Africa and Middle East hoping to make it to Europe . From Friday to Monday , a total of 8,480 migrants were rescued , according to the Italian coast guard , which said it received on Monday -- alone -- SOS calls from 20 boats in distress . On Tuesday , a spokesman with Save the Children told CNN the group fears 400 migrants could be missing , citing testimony from survivors who said their ship carrying 550 people capsized in the Mediterranean Sea about 80 miles off the Libyan coast . The Italian coast guard , however , told CNN that while it is taking the report seriously , it can not confirm such an incident and has not yet found evidence at sea to indicate a migrant boat carrying approximately 550 has capsized with 145 rescued . An operation that included boats and planes did not find any survivors , nor bodies , nor any evidence to indicate a particular boat capsized , Coast Guard official Filippo Marini said .

Sanchez had his selection of clubs once Barcelona had decided to let him leave , and following the World Cup , the 26-year-old was convinced to continue his career under Wenger 's expert guidance , going on to make an instant impression in English football . The French coach , however , admits the possibility Liverpool could use their interest in Sanchez as leverage during negotiations over Luis Suarez 's move to the Nou Camp last summer was always on the cards . Alexis Sanchez was courted by a number of elite clubs last summer but eventually chose Arsenal Sanchez has made an instant impact in English football and has scored 19 goals so far this season Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger ( right ) is delighted that Sanchez decided to join the north London club 'At the end of the day , only Sanchez can explain to you why he has chosen us . I do n't know why he did that , but we are happy that he made that decision , ' said Wenger of the \u00a332million Chile forward , who has netted 19 goals so far . ' I was ( aware of Liverpool 's interest ) , but you never know if it is really true , but I thought it could be because of the interest in Suarez ( from Barcelona ) . 'In the negotiations , yes , it is a strength - and it makes sense , an exchange and some money for Liverpool . ' Wenger believes the way Sanchez has adapted so quickly to a change in environment proves he is one of the best around . 'If you look at the qualities , efficiency , work-rate , fighting spirit - ( he is at the ) top , ' the Arsenal boss added . 'When it ( the game ) becomes flat , he can revitalise the strengths and dynamics of the team and the supporters . ' Ahead of the key Barclays Premier League clash , Wenger was keen to play down any talk of a potential summer transfer move for Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling , who has so far rejected a new contract offer . Despite the Reds having lost to Manchester United before the international break to dent hopes of another top-four finish , Wenger has been impressed by the way Brendan Rodgers has developed his team following the sale of Suarez and injury to striker Daniel Sturridge . 'He has done very well . I think he found a solution at the right time , ' the Arsenal manager said . 'They did well last season too , they scored over 100 goals in the Premier League , which is absolutely fantastic . ' Wenger has moved to play down speculation linking him with Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling",
